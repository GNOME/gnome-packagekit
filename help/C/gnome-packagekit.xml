  </para>
  <para>
    PackageKit is designed to unify all the software graphical tools used in
    different distributions.
    It abstracts the various underlying package management technologies like
    yum, apt, smart etc. and provides unified graphical and command line frontends.
    It also provides a framework that includes programming interfaces that other
    software applications can take advantage of.
    It is not a replacement for existing package managers like yum.
  </para>
  <para>
    Some of the architectural advantages of PackageKit over other package
    management solutions are that the PackageKit daemon runs as a system
    process that is not tied to any user session, which means that a
    long-running update or installation will not be interrupted if the user who
    started it logs out. Tasks are queued up, meaning that single users can
    initiate multiple tasks which will be executed one by one and also that
    multiple users can use PackageKit in parallel without completely locking
    each other out.inally, access to all privileged operations is controlled
    via <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolicyKit">PolicyKit</ulink>.

<section id="add-remove">
  <title>Add/Remove Software</title>
  <para>
    Add/Remove software application accessed via <menuchoice><guimenu>System</guimenu>
    <guisubmenu>Administration</guisubmenu>
    <guimenuitem>Add/Remove Software</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
    allows you to search the software repository easily or browse through the
    different groups like multimedia or office and select software packages to
    install or remove from your system.
    You can find more information about any package such as description and
    dependencies by just clicking on it.
    Before installing a package, you also can visit the home page of the
    software projects easily for getting any additional details.
  </para>
  <para>
    Typically, you can find several thousands of software packages under
    different groups available.
    Since this can be overwhelming you can choose to filter the lists of
    packages based on several criteria such as whether the package is already
    installed, whether it is a development or graphical application and based
    on the software license.
    See <xref linkend="filters"/> for more information about filters.
  </para>
  <para>
    A software source configuration is available in the system menu that
    allows you to enable or disable a existing software repository.
    You can also refresh the application lists for displaying the latest
    information about software packages available in the repository.
  </para>

  <section id="filters">
    <title>Filters</title>
    <para>
      You can limit the amount of packages that is shown by several criteria.
    </para>
    <para>
      To see only installed or only uninstalled packages, choose the
      corresponding menuitem in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Filters</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Installed</guisubmenu></menuchoice> menu.
    </para>
    <para>
      To see only packages that are required for developing software or only
      packages that are not for that purpose, choose a filter from
      the <menuchoice><guimenu>Filters</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Development</guisubmenu></menuchoice>
      menu. Typical packages in this category are compilers, programming
      languages or libraries.
    </para>
    <para>
      To see only packages containing applications with a graphical user
      interface or only applications with a commandline interface, choose a
      filter from the <menuchoice><guimenu>Filters</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Graphical</guisubmenu></menuchoice>
      menu.
    </para>
    <note><para>
      Note that PackageKit uses a heuristic to determine if a package is a 'graphical'
      application and can get this wrong when a package has dependencies like gtk2+.
    </para></note>
    <para>
      To see only packages that qualify as free software, choose the
      corresponding menuitem from the <menuchoice><guimenu>Filters</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Free</guisubmenu></menuchoice>
      menu. Currently, PackageKit considers a package to be free software
      if its license is listed as such in the Fedora
      <ulink url="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing">Licensing</ulink> page.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="searching">
    <title>Searching for software</title>
    <para>
      The search entry and <guibutton>Find</guibutton> button let you search
      for software packages. The icon inside the entry indicates what kind
      of search is performed. By clicking on it, you can select to search for
      a string that is contained in package name, the package description, or
      search for the name of a file contained in the package.
    </para>
  </section>

</section>

<section id="software-sources">
  <title>Software Sources</title>
  <para>
    The software repository viewer allows you to enable or disable software
    sources - also known as <quote>repositories</quote>. Repositories
    are collections of software packages that are known to work together and
    are compatible with your operating system. Apart from the repositories for
    the operating system itself, there are third-party repositories offering
    additional software for many Linux distributions - check your
    distribution-specific documentation for more information.
  </para>
  <para>
    At this time, PackageKit does not offer a way to add new repositories to
    your system. It only allows you to enable or disable known repositories.
    However, it is often possible to make a new repository known to PackageKit
    by installing a package with the necessary information. These are usually
    called (foo)-release, where foo is the name of the repository.
  </para>
</section>

<section id="update-viewer">
  <title>Update Viewer</title>
   <para>
     You can update your system via <menuchoice><guimenu>System</guimenu>
     <guisubmenu>Administration</guisubmenu>
     <guimenuitem>Update System</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
     or by selecting <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Show Updates</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
     from the update icon in the notification area.
     When you do this, the update viewer application launches and immediately
     starts checking for updates. Once this check completes, it shows you an
     overview of available updates, grouped by severity. The severities range
     from security updates over important updates to bug fix updates and
     finally enhancements.
   </para>
   <note><para>
     Note that the severity information must be provided by the software
     repositories where the packages originate. This information may not
     be available for development branches of distributions.
   </para></note>
   <para>
     Below the summary of available updates, the update viewer gives and
     indication how long ago the last check (or <quote>refresh</quote>)
     for new updates happened, and when updates where last installed.
   </para>
   <para>
     You can choose to manually refresh and verify the presence of
     updates by clicking the <guibutton>Refresh</guibutton> button.
   </para>
   <tip><para>
     You can change how often PackageKit refreshes on its own in
     the <link linkend="prefs">Software Update Preferences</link>.
   </para></tip>
   <para>
     There is a option to view the history of updates including
     previous installations, removal or updates of software.
   </para>
   <para>
     Use the <guibutton>Update System</guibutton> button to install
     all available updates or use the <guibutton>Review</guibutton>
     button to review and select individual updates.

     close the window.
   </para>

  <section id="update-viewer-details">
    <title>Detailed information about updates</title>
    <para>
      The <guibutton>Review</guibutton> button brings up a listing
      of the individual updates that are available. The area below
      the list displays detailed information about the selected update.
      The information may include references to bugs and vulnerability
      reports that are fixed by the update.
    </para>
    <note><para>
      Note that the detailed update information must be provided by the
      software repositories where the packages originate. This information
      may not be available for development branches of distributions.
    </para></note>
    <para>
      The checkboxes next to each package in the list allow to select
      individual updates for installation. Use the <guibutton>Apply
      Updates</guibutton> button to install only the selected updates.
      If you do not want to install updates at this time, you can just
      close the window.

    ones that fix security issues.
    These settings are per-user and effective only for the current user logged
    in the system.
 </para>
</section>

<section id="auto-updates">
  <title>Automatic Updates</title>
  <para>
    Automatic updates can be performed in the background system wide using the
    PackageKit-cron package.
    This package contains a cron job that as well as a configuration file.
    The settings are controlled via the configuration file at
    <command>/etc/sysconfig/packagekit-background</command>.
    You can set it to just check for updates or perform the updates
    automatically and notify any email address.
  </para>
</section>

<section id="update-icon">
  <title>Update Icon</title>
  <para>
     When PackageKit is installed, it starts the <command>gpk-update-icon</command>
     command when you log in. This application displays an icon in the
     notification area of your panel when software updates are available,
     and is responsible for showing notifications about PackageKit operations
     and events.
  </para>
  <para>
