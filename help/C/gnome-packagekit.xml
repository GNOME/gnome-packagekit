  </para>
  <para>
    PackageKit is designed to unify all the software graphical tools used in
    different distributions.
    It abstracts the various underlying package management technologies like
    yum, apt, smart etc. and provides unified graphical and command line frontends.
    It also provides a framework that includes programming interfaces that other
    software applications can take advantage of.
    It is not a replacement for existing package managers like yum.
  </para>
  <para>
    Some of the architectural advantages of PackageKit over other package management solutions are
    that the PackageKit daemon runs as a system process that is not tied to any user session,
    which means that a long-running update or installation will not be interrupted if the user who
    started it logs out.
    Tasks are queued up, meaning that a user can initiate multiple tasks which will be executed one
    by one and also that multiple users can also use PackageKit in parallel without completely
    locking each other out.
    Access to all privileged operations is controlled via
    <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolicyKit">PolicyKit</ulink>.

    allows you to search the software repository easily or browse through the
    different groups like multimedia or office and select software packages to
    install or remove from your system.
    You can find more information about any package such as description and
    dependencies by just clicking on it.
    Before installing a package, you also can visit the home page of the
    software projects easily for getting any additional details.

  <para>
    Typically, you can find several thousands of software packages under
    different groups available.
    Since this can be overwhelming you can choose to filter the lists of
    software packages based on several criteria such as whether the package is already
    installed, whether it is a development or graphical application and based
    on the software license.
    See <xref linkend="filters"/> for more information about filters.
  </para>
  <para>
    A software source configuration is available in the system menu that
    allows you to enable or disable a existing software repository.
    You can also refresh the application lists for displaying the latest
    information about software packages available in the repository.

  <section id="filters">
    <title>Filters</title>
    <para>
      You can limit the amount of software packages that is shown by several criteria.
    </para>
    <para>
      To see only installed or only uninstalled software, choose the
      corresponding menu item in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Filters</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Installed</guisubmenu></menuchoice> menu.
    </para>
    <para>
      To see only software containing applications with a graphical user
      interface or only applications with a command line interface, choose a
      filter from the <menuchoice><guimenu>Filters</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Graphical</guisubmenu></menuchoice>
      menu.
    </para>
    <note><para>
      Note that PackageKit uses a heuristic to determine if a package is a 'graphical'
      application and can get this wrong when a package has dependencies like gtk2+.
    </para></note>
    <para>
      To see only software that qualify as free software, choose the
      corresponding menu item from the <menuchoice><guimenu>Filters</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Free</guisubmenu></menuchoice>
      menu. Currently, PackageKit considers a package to be free software
      if its license is listed as such in the Fedora

<section id="software-sources">
  <title>Software Sources</title>
  <para>
    The software repository viewer allows you to enable or disable software
    sources - also known as <quote>repositories</quote>. Repositories
    are collections of software that are known to work together and
    are compatible with your operating system. Apart from the repositories for
    the operating system itself, there are third-party repositories offering
    additional software for many Linux distributions - check your
    distribution-specific documentation for more information.

  <para>
    At this time, PackageKit does not offer a way to add new repositories to
    your system. It only allows you to enable or disable known repositories.
    However, it is often possible to make a new repository known to PackageKit
    by installing a package with the necessary information. These are usually
    called (foo)-release, where foo is the name of the repository.

    Sometimes you will not have the software on your system to open a particular
    file. If the file type is not recognized, then applications that can open
    this file type are shown.
  </para>
  <para>
    At this time, only a limited number of results will be shown, as they will
    need to be rebuilt by the distribution to support the extra data needed by
    PackageKit. This will happen automatically, and soon all suitable
    applications will be shown.

<section id="update-viewer">
  <title>Update Viewer</title>

    or by selecting <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Show Updates</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
    from the update icon in the notification area.
    When you do this, the update viewer application launches and immediately
    starts checking for updates. Once this check completes, it shows you an
    overview of available updates, grouped by severity. The severities range
    from security updates over important updates to bug fix updates and
    finally enhancements.

  <para>
    Computer B wants to have a service pack containing a new version of
    <literal>k3b</literal> so that it can burn DVD-RWs.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <literal>k3b</literal> program has dependencies of <literal>dbus</literal>,
    <literal>dbus-glib</literal> and <literal>kdebase</literal>.
    Now, if we asked computer A to download <literal>k3b</literal>, it would download
    <literal>k3b</literal> <emphasis>and</emphasis> <literal>kdebase</literal>, but
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> <literal>dbus-glib</literal>.
    We need to provide computer A with the information about what packages computer B
    has got installed before we can create the service pack.
  </para>
  <para>
    If we generate a package list on computer B, and the transfer it to
    computer A on a USB pendrive or CD-RW we can download the correct packages.
    In this case we would download <literal>k3b</literal> and
    <literal>dbus-glib</literal> and pack it into the new service pack.
  </para>
  <para>
    The service pack can now be transferred from computer A to computer B on
    the USB pendrive.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <command>pkgenpack</command> command line tool can also be used for
    creating service pack files.

<section id="auto-updates">
  <title>Automatic Updates</title>
  <para>
    Automatic updates can be performed in the background system wide using the
    PackageKit-cron package.
    The settings are controlled via the configuration file at
    <filename>/etc/sysconfig/packagekit-background</filename>.
    You can set it to just check for updates or perform the updates
    automatically and notify any email address.
  </para>
</section>

<section id="update-icon">
  <title>Update Icon</title>
  <para>
     The icon offers menu items for installing the available updates or
     for starting the update viewer, which allows you to obtain detailed
     information about the available updates before installing them. See
     <xref linkend="update-viewer"/> for more information.

<section id="eula">
  <title>Agreeing to EULAs</title>
  <para>
    A license agreement is a contract between a producer and a user of software
    which grants the user a software license.
    A software license agreement defines the legal terms under which a user
    may use the software.
    This is called an end-user license agreement or EULA for short.
  </para>
  <para>
    Many EULAs assert extensive liability limitations for the software.
    Typically a EULA will hold the software producer immune in the event that
    the software causes damage to the computer hardware or data.
    Some software also includes limitations if the user can be held liable for
    damage that arises through improper use of the software.
  </para>

    Be sure to carefully read and accept the EULA text before continuing with
    the install or update.

<section id="gpg-signature">
  <title>Accepting a security signature</title>
  <para>
    Packages from a software source are typically signed by the project managing
    the repository or packages.
    This allows users to be sure a package signed with a security key is
    actually from the software source it claims to be.
  </para>
  <para>
    For a package management infrastructure to operate effectively, it has to
    trust repositories so that updates can be downloaded and installed
    automatically.
    The other benefit is that signed packages can be installed without using the
    administrator password, assuming your admin has enabled this option.
  </para>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>
  </figure>
  <para>
    To trust a repository, you should verify the details of the signing key.
    Normally the best way to do this is to go to the web page of the software
    source, and try to find details about the key used to sign the packages.
    This is normally called a <literal>GPG key</literal>.
  </para>
  <para>
    You should only proceed with this dialog if you are happy to trust packages
    from this software source.
  </para>

<section id="dialogs">
  <title>Common Dialogs Explained</title>
  <para>
    This application tries to reuse dialogs as much as possible, so that there
    is a repeatable and consistent user interface when managing packages.
    In the following subsections, some of the dialogs will be explained further,
    often with examples or web links.

    <para>
      If a file has been downloaded to your home directory, it is usually
      downloaded to a location similar to <literal>/home/hughsie/Downloads</literal>.
      The PackageKit service is not run as the same user as the the normal
      desktop user, and so the daemon would not normally be able to access this file.
      If the download folder cannot be read by the root user then it is copied to a
      temporary directory so it can be accessed.

      A package catalog is a simple file that indicates that other packages should
      be installed.
      There are no optional packages, as a catalog file is designed to be simple
      and need no user interaction.
      Using a catalog file allows you to install different packages quickly and easily.
