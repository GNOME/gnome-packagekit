#. TRANSLATORS:
#. The original application is the program that was opened by the user,
#. and that requested the PackageKit action.
#. If the user then closes the application, but the task is still running
#. (for instance, updating the system) then the original application is
#. marked as not running.
#. This is the only time we should show the progress icon in the tray,
#. as the user would have no other way to interact with, or cancel the task.
#.
#. Some people like being able to interact with the task for debugging
#. or just because they want to know what is happening in other user sessions.
#. Those sort of people (not typical users) should enable this option.
